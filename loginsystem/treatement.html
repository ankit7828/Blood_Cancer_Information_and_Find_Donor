            There are a range of different treatments for blood cancer. The
            treatment your doctors recommend will depend on the
            <span style="color: #0aedc0">type of blood cancer</span> you have,
            your health, and your wishes.
          </h3>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            You might have one type of treatment or a number of them. Some
            people with a slow-growing blood cancer may not need treatment
            straight away.

            <h1>Treatement</h1>
            <p>
              Some people with blood cancer don’t need treatment straight away,
              and some never need it. If you have a slow-growing blood cancer,
              your doctor may recommend watch and wait. You will be monitored
              with regular check-ups and blood tests, but you won’t need to have
              active treatment. <br /><br /><br />

              Watch and wait doesn’t mean that you can’t be treated. It’s
              offered when your doctor believes there’s no added benefit to
              starting treatment straight away.<br /><br /><br />

              If the cancer is not causing any troublesome symptoms, watch and
              wait is a safe approach that avoids the side effects of cancer
              treatments. You’ll only start treatment if and when you need it.

          <h1>Chemotherapy</h1>
          <p>
            Chemotherapy means using cell-killing drugs to destroy cancer cells.
            <br /><br />

            Chemotherapy is often given directly into a vein. The drugs can
            travel around the body in the bloodstream and kill the cancer cells.
            This is called intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. It’s also called
            having an infusion (a drip).<br /><br />

            Usually, the chemotherapy is in a bag of fluid with a tube coming
            from it that goes into a vein in your hand, arm or chest. It can
            take several hours to receive chemotherapy into a vein in this way,
            or sometimes more than a day. Many people have chemotherapy as an
            outpatient – that means you come to hospital for treatment and can
            go home again afterwards.<br /><br />

            Chemotherapy can also be given as tablets, sometimes as a course of
            treatment, or sometimes as a more long-term treatment.<br /><br />

            Chemotherapy is often given in cycles. A cycle includes having some
            chemotherapy, and then having a rest period with no treatment. For
            example, you may have chemotherapy once a day for five days, and
            then have three weeks with no treatment. This is one cycle. The
            number of cycles you have and what they involve will depend on the
            type of blood cancer and drugs you are having.<br /><br />

            Whilst chemotherapy can kill cancer cells, it also damages healthy
            cells in your body. This is what causes the side effects of
            chemotherapy.

          <h1><span style="color: #0aedc0;">Stem cell transplant</span></h1>
          <p>
            A stem cell transplant means replacing the stem cells in your body
            with new, healthy stem cells.<br /><br />

            Stem cells are cells at an early stage of development. All blood
            cells start off as stem cells in the bone marrow. Blood cancer
            happens when something goes wrong with the development of your blood
            cells and they become cancerous. <br /><br />

            A stem cell transplant can be a treatment for some blood cancers
            because it involves destroying the abnormal stem cells that are
            producing cancerous blood cells, and giving your body new, healthy
            stem cells that can make healthy blood cells again. This involves
            having high doses of chemotherapy to destroy your existing stem
            cells, and then having the transplant to replenish your bone marrow
            with healthy stem cells.<br /><br />

            A stem cell transplant is also used to replace your stem cells if
            you need high doses of chemotherapy to treat your blood cancer,
            which as a result damages your bone marrow and stem cells.<br /><br />

            There are two types of stem cell transplant:<br /><br />

            Autograft/autologous: where your own stem cells are collected and
            stored, and given back to you later by transplant
            Allograft/allogeneic: where someone else’s stem cells (a donor’s)
            are used for the transplant.<br />
            The way the cells are given to you during the transplant is into
            your vein, in a similar way to having chemotherapy or a blood
            transfusion.
