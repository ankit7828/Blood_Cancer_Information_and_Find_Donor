          <h1>Blood Cancer Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Your blood, which accounts for about 8 percent of your normal body
            weight, plays an important role in how your body functions. As your
            blood circulates throughout your vascular system, it supplies all of
            your organs with oxygen, nutrients, hormones and antibodies. Blood
            is made of an almost equal mix of plasma (the liquid that transports
            cells, waste and nutrients, among other things) and blood cells (red
            blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). <br /><br />

            When cancer occurs in the blood, it’s usually the result of an
            abnormal and excessive reproduction of white blood cells. Blood
            cancers account for about 10 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the
            U.S. each year. Blood cancers (including leukemia, lymphoma and
            myeloma) are more common in men than women. Childhood leukemia
            accounts for about 25 percent of all cancers in children.
            <br /><br />
            “Some blood cancers may cause symptoms such as severe fatigue,
            weight loss, night sweats, or lymph node swelling,” says Scott
            Frederick Huntington, MD, MPH, a Yale Medicine hematologist in the
            Department of Hematology. “Other blood cancers may show no symptoms
            and slowly progress over years.”
            <br /><br />
            Treatments for blood cancers also vary, ranging from active
            surveillance without cancer-directed therapy to standard cancer
            treatments including immunotherapies, chemotherapies and targeted
            agents. “With over 100 different types of blood cancers now
            recognized, it is important to have an accurate diagnosis prior to
            deciding on treatment,” says Dr. Huntington. Yale Medicine has both
            clinicians and pathologists who specialize in blood cancers and
            review challenging cases during tumor boards to reach a consensus
            prior to starting therapy.

           <h1> What, exactly, is blood?</h1>
            <p>Blood has four main parts: <br></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b> Plasma,</b> the liquid part of blood that transports nutrients, waste products, and proteins and other molecules responsible for affecting the function of various parts of the body, including regulating body temperature and fluid balance</li><br>
                <li><b>Red blood cells,</b> the cells responsible for transporting oxygen to lungs and tissues</li><br>
                <li><b>White blood cells,</b> the cells responsible for protecting against infections</li><br>
                <li><b>Platelets,</b> the cells that form blood clots and prevent blood loss</li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cause-data">
            <h1>What is blood cancer?</h1>
            <p>Cancer is caused by a dysfunction in cellular growth and behavior. In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones. The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cause-data">
           <h1>How many kinds of blood cancer exist?</h1>
            <p>There are three primary types of blood cancer: <br><br>

                <b>Leukemia</b> is cancer of white blood cells or cells that become white blood cells. Leukemia prevents white blood cells from fighting infections in your body. Leukemia can be either acute (fast-growing) or chronic (slower-growing), and affect the lymphocytes (lymphocytic leukemia) or other immune cells (myeloid leukemia). It’s the most common blood cancer for children under the age of 15. <br><br>
               <b> Lymphoma</b> is cancer of the lymphatic system (an important part of the immune system), particularly lymph nodes (small bean-shaped structures of the lymphatic system that filter out harmful substances). It affects a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The type doctors know the most about is called Hodgkin’s lymphoma (or Hodgkin’s disease). (All others are called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.) It’s the most common form of blood cancer in adults, accounting for over half of all diagnosed blood cancer cases. <br><br>
                <b>Myeloma</b> is cancer of the plasma cells, which are lymphocytes that make antibodies to protect against infections. Myeloma affects your body’s immune system, leaving it susceptible to infection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cause-data">
           <h1>Who is at risk for blood cancer?</h1>
            <p>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Smoking, radiation exposure, and exposure to certain chemicals have all been linked to increased risk of some types of blood cancers. Epstein-Barr virus, HIV and human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus infections are also risk factors for developing lymphomas and leukemias.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cause-data">
            <h1>What are the symptoms of blood cancer?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Chills</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Weakness</li>
                <li>Bone and joint pain</li>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The swelling of lymph nodes, liver and spleen are also common, and anemia can occur in some blood cancers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cause-data">
            <h1>How is blood cancer diagnosed?</h1>
               <p><b>Leukemia:</b> Your doctor will obtain a complete blood count (CBC) test, which can identify abnormal levels of white blood cells relative to red blood cells and platelets. <br><br>
                <b>Lymphoma:</b> Your doctor will need to perform a biopsy, which removes a small portion of tissue to be examined under a microscope. In some cases, your doctor may also order an X-ray, CT or PET scan to detect swollen lymph nodes. <br><br>
                <b>Myeloma:</b> Your doctor will order a CBC, or other blood or urine tests to detect chemicals or proteins produced as a function of myeloma development. In some cases, bone marrow biopsy, X-ray, MRI, PET, and CT scans can be used to confirm the presence and extent of the spread of myeloma.</p>
